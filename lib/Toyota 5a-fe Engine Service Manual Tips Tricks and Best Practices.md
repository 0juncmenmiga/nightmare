# How to Repair and Maintain Your Toyota 5A-FE Engine
 
The Toyota 5A-FE is a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that was produced by Toyota from 1988 to 2003. It was used in various models of Toyota cars, such as Corolla, Soluna, Tercel, and Paseo. The 5A-FE engine features a cast-iron block and an aluminum head with dual overhead camshafts (DOHC) and four valves per cylinder. It has a compression ratio of 9.8:1 and delivers from 92.5 to 103 horsepower and from 94.3 to 101 pound-feet of torque.
 
If you own a car with a 5A-FE engine, you may want to know how to repair and maintain it properly. In this article, we will provide you with some useful information on how to do that, based on the official Toyota service manual[^1^] and other reliable sources[^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. However, please note that this article is for general guidance only and does not replace the need for professional diagnosis and service.

## Valve Clearance Adjustment
 
One of the basic maintenance tasks for the 5A-FE engine is to adjust the valve clearance. The valve clearance is the gap between the valve stem and the rocker arm. If the valve clearance is too tight or too loose, it can affect the engine performance, fuel economy, noise, and emissions. Therefore, it is recommended to check and adjust the valve clearance every 60,000 miles or 48 months.
 
To adjust the valve clearance, you will need a feeler gauge, a wrench, a screwdriver, and a new valve cover gasket. The procedure is as follows:

1. Remove the spark plug wires and the valve cover.
2. Turn the crankshaft pulley until the No.1 piston is at top dead center (TDC) on the compression stroke. You can check this by aligning the timing marks on the crankshaft pulley and the timing belt cover.
3. Using a feeler gauge, measure the clearance between the valve stem and the rocker arm for each valve. The standard clearance is 0.15-0.25 mm (0.006-0.010 in) for the intake valves and 0.25-0.35 mm (0.010-0.014 in) for the exhaust valves.
4. If the clearance is out of specification, loosen the lock nut and turn the adjusting screw until the clearance is within specification. Then tighten the lock nut and recheck the clearance.
5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 for each cylinder in the firing order: 1-3-4-2.
6. Install a new valve cover gasket and reinstall the valve cover and the spark plug wires.

## Spark Plug Replacement
 
Another important maintenance task for the 5A-FE engine is to replace the spark plugs. The spark plugs are responsible for igniting the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chambers. If the spark plugs are worn out or fouled, they can cause poor engine performance, misfires, increased fuel consumption, and emissions problems. Therefore, it is recommended to replace the spark plugs every 30,000 miles or 24 months.
 
To replace the spark plugs, you will need a spark plug wrench, a gap gauge, and new spark plugs. The procedure is as follows:

1. Remove the spark plug wires from the spark plugs by pulling them gently by their boots. Do not pull them by their wires.
2. Using a spark plug wrench, remove each spark plug from its cylinder.
3. Inspect each spark plug for signs of wear, damage, or fouling. If any of these conditions are present, replace all spark plugs.
4. Using a gap gauge, measure and adjust the gap of each new spark plug to 1.1 mm (0.043 in).
5. Apply a thin coat of anti-seize compound to the threads of each new spark plug.
