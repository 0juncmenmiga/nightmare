In this article, we will review some of the main features of Sony Acid Pro 5 and how it can help you produce professional-sounding music tracks with ease.
 
## Groove Mapping
 
One of the new features in Sony Acid Pro 5 is Groove Mapping, which lets you apply a groove or swing feel to your loops. A groove is a subtle variation in timing that gives your music more life and expression. You can use the built-in Groove Pool to choose from a variety of grooves, or you can extract the groove from any loop in your project and apply it to other tracks. You can also adjust the amount and offset of the groove to fine-tune the feel of your music.
 
## Media Manager
 
Another new feature in Sony Acid Pro 5 is the Media Manager, which helps you organize and manage your loops and samples. The Media Manager is a dockable window that lets you browse, preview, tag and search for media files on your computer or online. You can also drag and drop media files from the Media Manager to the timeline or the Explorer window. The Media Manager supports various file formats, including MP3, WMA, WMV, AAC, FLAC and Dolby Digital AC-3.
 
## Rewire Support
 
Sony Acid Pro 5 also improves its Rewire support, which allows you to sync and integrate it with other Rewire-compatible applications, such as Reason, Cubase or Pro Tools. Rewire lets you use Acid as a master or slave device, and route audio and MIDI data between different programs. This way, you can expand your sonic possibilities and use Acid as part of a larger production environment.
 
## Other Features
 
Besides these new features, Sony Acid Pro 5 also retains its core functionality and user interface that make it easy and fun to use. Some of the other features include:
 
- Folder Tracks: A new way to group and organize your tracks in the timeline. You can collapse or expand folder tracks to save space and simplify your workflow.
- MIDI Editing: A powerful tool for creating and editing MIDI data directly on the timeline. You can use inline editing, drum editor or piano roll editor to program beats, melodies or chords.
- VST Support: A feature that allows you to use VST instruments and effects in your project. You can access hundreds of virtual synths, samplers and processors to enhance your sound.
- zplane ÃƒÂ©lastique: A high-quality algorithm for pitch-shifting and time-stretching loops. You can change the tempo and pitch of your loops without affecting their quality or introducing artifacts.
- Realtime Envelope Curve Animation: A feature that lets you record automation data for volume, pan, effects or other parameters during playback. You can use your mouse or an external MIDI controller to create dynamic changes in your music.
- Mastering & Export: A feature that lets you burn CDs, upload your music to ACIDplanet.com or encode your tracks in various formats, such as MP3, WMA, WMV, AAC, FLAC or Dolby Digital AC-3.
