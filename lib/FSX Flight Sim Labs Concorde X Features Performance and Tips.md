The Concorde was the result of a long and ambitious research and development project that started in the early 1950s. The British and French governments decided to collaborate on the design and production of a supersonic airliner that could compete with the American Boeing 707 and other subsonic jets. The project faced many technical, political and economic challenges, but also received strong support from both countries' leaders, such as Charles de Gaulle and Harold Macmillan.
 
The Concorde made its first flight on March 2, 1969, from Toulouse, France, piloted by AndrÃ© Turcat and Brian Trubshaw. The flight lasted 27 minutes and reached a speed of Mach 1.05. The Concorde underwent extensive testing and certification before entering commercial service in 1976. The first scheduled flights were from London to Bahrain and from Paris to Rio de Janeiro, followed by Washington D.C. and New York City later that year. The Concorde was able to cross the Atlantic Ocean in less than half the time of conventional airliners, thanks to its advanced aerodynamics, engines and materials.
 
The Concorde was a symbol of prestige and innovation for both Air France and British Airways, the only two airlines that operated it. The Concorde attracted many celebrities, dignitaries and wealthy passengers who could afford the high fares. The Concorde also set several world records, such as the fastest circumnavigation of the Earth by a commercial aircraft in 1992. However, the Concorde also faced many difficulties, such as high operating costs, environmental concerns, noise restrictions, limited market demand and competition from cheaper subsonic jets. The Concorde's fate was sealed by the tragic crash of Air France Flight 4590 in 2000, which killed all 109 people on board and four on the ground. After a brief suspension and a series of safety modifications, the Concorde resumed service in 2001, but was retired for good in 2003 due to low passenger numbers and rising maintenance costs.
