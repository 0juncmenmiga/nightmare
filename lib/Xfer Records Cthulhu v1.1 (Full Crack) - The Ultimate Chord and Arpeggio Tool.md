# Xfer Records Cthulhu v1.1: A Powerful Chord and Arp Generator
 
Xfer Records Cthulhu v1.1 is a VST/AU plugin that allows you to create complex chord progressions and arpeggios with ease. Cthulhu consists of two modules: the Chords module and the Arp module. The Chords module lets you trigger full chords by playing single notes. Each trigger note is associated with a separate chord. Each chord may consist of any number of notes. You can choose from hundreds of chord presets or create your own custom chords. The Arp module transforms the chords into impressive arpeggiated patterns. You can control the speed, direction, rhythm, octave range, groove, swing, and more. You can also import MIDI files to use as arpeggio patterns.
